This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIREDOn Friday, a lone Microsoft developer rocked the world when he revealed a backdoor had been intentionally planted in XZ Utils, an open source data compression utility available on almost all installations of Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. The person or people behind this project likely spent years on it. They were likely very close to seeing the backdoor update merged into Debian and Red Hat, the two biggest distributions of Linux, when an eagle-eyed software developer spotted something fishy.\"This might be the best executed supply chain attack we've seen described in the open, and it's a nightmare scenario: malicious, competent, authorized upstream in a widely used library,\" software and cryptography engineer Filippo Valsorda said of the effort, which came frightfully close to succeeding.Researchers have spent the weekend gathering clues. Here's what we know so far.What Is XZ Utils?XZ Utils is nearly ubiquitous in Linux. It provides lossless data compression on virtually all Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. XZ Utils provides critical functions for compressing and decompressing data during all kinds of operations. XZ Utils also supports the legacy .lzma format, making this component even more crucial.What Happened?Andres Freund, a developer and engineer working on Microsoft’s PostgreSQL offerings, was recently troubleshooting performance problems a Debian system was experiencing with SSH, the most widely used protocol for remotely logging in to devices over the Internet. Specifically, SSH logins were consuming too many CPU cycles and were generating errors with valgrind, a utility for monitoring computer memory.Through sheer luck and Freund’s careful eye, he eventually discovered the problems were the result of updates that had been made to XZ Utils. On Friday, Freund took to the Open Source Security List to disclose the updates were the result of someone intentionally planting a backdoor in the compression software.It's hard to overstate the complexity of the social engineering and the inner workings of the backdoor. Thomas Roccia, a researcher at Microsoft, published a graphic on Mastodon that helps visualize the sprawling extent of the nearly successful endeavor to spread a backdoor with a reach that would have dwarfed the SolarWinds event from 2020.What Does the Backdoor Do?Malicious code added to xz Utils versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 modified the way the software functions. The backdoor manipulated sshd, the executable file used to make remote SSH connections. Anyone in possession of a predetermined encryption key could stash any code of their choice in an SSH login certificate, upload it, and execute it on the backdoored device. No one has actually seen code uploaded, so it's not known what code the attacker planned to run. In theory, the code could allow for just about anything, including stealing encryption keys or installing malware.Wait, How Can a Compression Utility Manipulate a Process as Security-Sensitive as SSH?Any library can tamper with the inner workings of any executable it is linked against. Often, the developer of the executable will establish a link to a library that's needed for it to work properly. OpenSSH, the most popular sshd implementation, doesn’t link the liblzma library, but Debian and many other Linux distributions add a patch to link sshd to systemd, a program that loads a variety of services during the system bootup. Systemd, in turn, links to liblzma, and this allows XZ Utils to exert control over sshd.How Did This Backdoor Come to Be?It would appear that this backdoor was years in the making. In 2021, someone with the username JiaT75 made their first known commit to an open source project. In retrospect, the change to the libarchive project is suspicious, because it replaced the safe_fprint funcion with a variant that has long been recognized as less secure. No one noticed at the time.Ars TechnicaThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica, a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by WIRED's parent company, Condé Nast.The following year, JiaT75 submitted a patch over the XZ Utils mailing list, and, almost immediately, a never-before-seen participant named Jigar Kumar joined the discussion and argued that Lasse Collin, the longtime maintainer of XZ Utils, hadn’t been updating the software often or fast enough. Kumar, with the support of Dennis Ens and several other people who had never had a presence on the list, pressured Collin to bring on an additional developer to maintain the project.In January 2023, JiaT75 made their first commit to XZ Utils. In the months following, JiaT75, who used the name Jia Tan, became increasingly involved in XZ Utils affairs. For instance, Tan replaced Collins’ contact information with their own on oss-fuzz, a project that scans open source software for vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Tan also requested that oss-fuzz disable the ifunc function during testing, a change that prevented it from detecting the malicious changes Tan would soon make to XZ Utils.In February of this year, Tan issued commits for versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 of XZ Utils. The updates implemented the backdoor. In the following weeks, Tan or others appealed to developers of Ubuntu, Red Hat, and Debian to merge the updates into their OSes. Eventually, one of the two updates made its way into several releases, according to security firm Tenable. There’s more about Tan and the timeline here.Can You Say More About What This Backdoor Does?In a nutshell, it allows someone with the right private key to hijack sshd, the executable file responsible for making SSH connections, and from there to execute malicious commands. The backdoor is implemented through a five-stage loader that uses a series of simple but clever techniques to hide itself. It also provides the means for new payloads to be delivered without major changes being required.Multiple people who have reverse-engineered the updates have much more to say about the backdoor. Developer Sam James provided an overview here.In an online interview, developer and reverse engineer HD Moore confirmed the Sam James suspicion that the backdoor targeted either Debian or Red Hat distributions.“The attack was sneaky in that it only did the final steps of the backdoor if you were building the library on amd64 (intel x86 64-bit) and were building a Debian or a RPM package (instead of using it for a local installation),” he wrote.Paraphrasing observations from researchers who collectively spent the weekend analyzing the malicious updates, he continued:When verifying an SSH public key, if the public key matches a certain fingerprint function, the key contents are decrypted using a pre-shared key before the public key is actually verified. The decrypted contents are then passed directly to system.If the fingerprint doesn't match or the decrypted contents don't match a certain format, it falls back to regular key verification and no-one's the wiser.The backdoor is super sneaky. It uses a little-known feature of the glibc to hook a function. It only triggers when the backdoored xz library gets loaded by a /usr/bin/sshd process on one of the affected distributions. There may be many other backdoors, but the one everyone is talking about uses the function indirection stuff to add the hook. The payload was encoded into fake xz test files and runs as a shellcode effectively, changing the SSH RSA key verification code so that a magic public key (sent during normal authentication) let the attacker gain access​​Their grand scheme was:sneakily backdoor the release tarballs, but not the source codeuse sockpuppet accounts to convince the various Linux distributions to pull the latest version and package itonce those distributions shipped it, they could take over any downstream user/company system/etcResearchers from networking firm Akamai also explain well how the backdoor works here.What More Do We Know About Jia Tan?At the moment, extremely little, especially for someone entrusted to steward a piece of software as ubiquitous and as sensitive as XZ Utils. This developer persona has touched dozens of other pieces of open source software in the past few years. At the moment, it’s unknown if there was ever a real-world person behind this username or if Jia Tan is a completely fabricated individual.Additional technical analysis is available from the above Bluesky thread from Valsorda, researcher Kevin Beaumont, and Freund’s Friday disclosure.Is There a CVE Tracking Designation?Yes, it's CVE-2024-3094.How Do I Know If the Backdoor Is Present on My Device?There are several ways. One is this page from security firm Binarly. The tool detects implementation of IFUNC and is based on behavioral analysis. It can automatically detect invariants in the event a similar backdoor is implanted elsewhere.There's also a project called xzbot. It provides the following:honeypot: fake vulnerable server to detect exploit attemptsed448 patch: patch liblzma.so to use our own ED448 public keybackdoor format: format of the backdoor payloadbackdoor demo: cli to trigger the RCE assuming knowledge of the ED448 private keyThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica.Updated 4/2/2024, 1:23 pm ET to include additional details.You Might Also Like …In your inbox: Get Plaintext—Steven Levy's long view on techSee the thousands of apps hijacked to spy on your locationBig Story: The king of Ozempic is scared as hellThe ‘largest illicit online marketplace’ everUncanny Valley: An insider look at the influence of Silicon ValleyDan Goodin is IT Security Editor at Ars TechnicaXTopicsArs Technicasecurityopen sourcehackingmalwareLinuxRead MoreThe Best VPNs to Protect Yourself OnlineIt won’t solve all of your privacy problems, but a virtual private network can make you a less tempting target for hackers.Scott GilbertsonUSB-C Is Now the Law of the Land in EuropeApple has already pulled devices to comply with the European Commission’s new Common Charger Directive.Kevin Purdy, Ars TechnicaMicrosoft Says It's Time to Replace Your Old Windows 10 PCThe company is using the carrot of \"new features\" and the stick of \"no more updates for your old PC.\"Andrew CunninghamSave 10% On a Website With This Squarespace Promo CodeGet 10% off your next website or domain project at Squarespace when you apply our coupon at checkout.Molly HigginsThe Best Mesh Wi-Fi RoutersForget about patchy internet connections and dead spots in the house.

      "On March 29th, it was reported that malicious code enabling unauthorized remote SSH access has been detected within XZ Utils, a widely used package present in major Linux distributions (The GitHub project originally hosted here is now suspended). Fortunately, the malicious code was discovered quickly by the OSS community and managed to infect only two of the most recent versions of the package, 5.6.0 and 5.6.1, which were released within the past month. Stable versions of most Linux distributions were not affected.\n",
      "The sophisticated malicious payload that came with the affected versions of XZ Utils ran in the same process as the OpenSSH server (SSHD) and modified decryption routines in the OpenSSH server in order to allow specific remote attackers (that own a specific private key) to send arbitrary payloads through SSH which will be executed before the authentication step, effectively hijacking the entire victim machine.\n",
      "This supply chain attack came as a shock to the OSS community, as XZ Utils was considered a trusted and scrutinized project. The attacker built up a credible reputation as an OSS developer over the span of multiple years and used highly obfuscated code in order to evade detection by code reviews. Following our initial research communication, this post will detail its fundamentals and impact.\n",

      "What is the malicious payload of CVE-2024-3094?\n",
      "TL;DR – the end goal of the malicious backdoor introduced by CVE-2024-3094, is to inject code to the OpenSSH server (SSHD) that runs on the victim machine, and allow specific remote attackers (that own a specific private key) to either –\n",
      "1. Send arbitrary payloads through SSH which will be executed before the authentication step\n",
      "OR\n",
      "2. Bypass SSH password-based authentication (attacker can login with any password)\n",
      "Both of these abilities effectively hijack the entire victim machine.\n",
      "The backdoor payload is still under analysis, but based on preliminary analysis, initial open-source tools and technical tweets it seems that the payload is highly sophisticated –\n",
      "\n",
      "The payload gets injected into OpenSSH server (sshd process), since liblzma (that contains the malicious code) is a dependency of certain builds of OpenSSH.\n",
      "The payload hooks the RSA_public_decrypt function, a function originally used for validating RSA signatures.\n",
      "The malicious hook code examines the RSA public modulus (“N” value) passed inside the RSA struct (4th argument of RSA_public_decrypt). Note that this modulus is completely controlled by the connecting SSH client (in our case, the attackers).\n",
      "The malicious hook code examines the first 16 bytes of the “N” value, which are used in a simple calculation to derive a “Command Number” between 0 and 3. The command number sets the backdoor’s current operation –\n",
      "– Command 0x00 – Unknown\n",
      "– Command 0x01 – SSH authentication bypass\n",
      "– Command 0x02 – Execute shell command\n",
      "– Command 0x03 – Execute shell command with specified UID/GID\n",
      "The malicious hook code then decrypts the last 240 bytes of the “N” value using the ChaCha20 symmetric stream cipher, with a hardcoded decryption key –\n",
      "0a 31 fd 3b 2f 1f c6 92 92 68 32 52 c8 c1 ac 28\n",
      "34 d1 f2 c9 75 c4 76 5e b1 f6 88 58 88 93 3e 48\n",
      "Since this is a symmetric, hardcoded key it can be used to decrypt network captures of real-world attack attempts to understand which commands were sent from the attacker to the victim.\n",
      "The decrypted data contains 114 bytes of signature which are checked for validity by using the Ed448 asymmetric elliptic curve signing algorithm, specifically using the following Ed448 public key –\n",
      "0a 31 fd 3b 2f 1f c6 92 92 68 32 52 c8 c1 ac 28\n",

      "20 d3 2c 60 2b 2c 6d 31 00While the public key is well-known, only the attackers have the corresponding Ed448 private signing key, ensuring that only the attackers can generate valid payloads for the backdoor. Furthermore, the signature is bound to the host’s public key, meaning that a valid signature for one host cannot be reused on a different host.\n",
      "If the signature was verified as valid, the backdoor uses the bytes directly following the signature bytes as command-specific payload data. For example in command 0x02, the payload bytes contain A NULL-terminated shell command string (ex. cat /etc/shadow), that is directly passed to system()\n",
      "If the data is invalid in any way (malformed payload, invalid signature), the original implementation of RSA_public_decrypt is resumed in a transparent manner. This means the detection of vulnerable machines over the network may be impossible for anyone besides the attackers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sophisticated nature of this attack and the use of highly future proof crypto algorithms (Ed448 vs the more standard Ed25519) led many to believe that the attack may be a nation-state level cyberattack.\n",
      "Researchers have published an initial backdoor client that allows sending payloads (shell commands) to machines affected with CVE-2024-3094, given the backdoor’s Ed448 private signing key. Since the original Ed448 private signing key is not publicly known, this tool is mostly relevant for research purposes (to be used against patched versions of the backdoor, where the Ed448 public key has been replaced by a keypair with a known private key)\n",
      "Timeline of the attack\n",
      "The most notable part of this supply chain attack is the extreme levels of dedication of the attacker, working more than two years to establish themselves as a legitimate maintainer, offering to pick up work in various OSS projects and committing code across multiple projects in order to avoid detection.\n",
      "2021 – GitHub user Jia Tan (JiaT75) account created. Started contributing to several projects with 546 commits done in 2021, of which the most suspicious one was made to libarchive. A more detailed account of this commit can be found below.\n",

      "Introducing the ifunc implementation to XZ Utils\n",
      "Interestingly, this patch was introduced by the original maintainer of the package, Lasse Collin, who credited another contributor for this patch, Hans Jansen.

      "2023, July 8th – JiaT75 opens a Pull Request in oss-fuzz, a project that performs fuzz testing on XZ and many other OSS projects. The PR disables ifunc fuzzing, which effectively prevents oss-fuzz from finding the malicious changes done in XZ.\n",
      "2024, February 15th – JiaT75 adds an ignore rule for build-to-host.m4 in the XZ repository, via its .gitignore file.

      "In 2021, JiaT75 submitted a pull request to the libarchive repository with the title ‘Added error text to warning when untaring with bsdtar’ which seemed legitimate at first glance. However, upon closer inspection, it was discovered that the code in this pull request replaced the safe function safe_fprintf() with the unsafe version fprintf(), potentially introducing a character escape vulnerability. The security implications of this change are currently being investigated, as they are not yet clear. However, since a malicious actor is involved in this code modification, it is reasonable to assume that more sophisticated attacks might be at play in this investigation. A PoC for characters escape was already published:\n",
      "PoC by mikesiegel\n",
      "A fix to this vulnerability was introduced to libarchive main branch but has not yet been released as a version update at the time of writing.\n",
      "oss-fuzz:\n",

      "\n",
      "Later in 2023, they opened another PR to disable `Indirect function support` in the fuzzer’s configuration for the XZ project. This looks like preparation for the backdoor they were going to add later to the XZ project to prevent detection by the fuzzer –\n",

      "Page: Backdoor (computing)\n",
      "Summary: A backdoor is a typically covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer, product, embedded device (e.g. a home router), or its embodiment (e.g. part of a cryptosystem, algorithm, chipset, or even a \"homunculus computer\"—a tiny computer-within-a-computer such as that found in Intel's AMT technology). Backdoors are most often used for securing remote access to a computer, or obtaining access to plaintext in cryptosystems. From there it may be used to gain access to privileged information like passwords, corrupt or delete data on hard drives, or transfer information within autoschediastic networks.\n",
      "In the United States, the 1994 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act forces internet providers to provide backdoors for government authorities.  In 2024, the U.S. government realized that China had been tapping communications in the U.S. using that infrastructure for months, or perhaps longer; China recorded presidential candidate campaign office phone calls —including employees of the then-vice president of the nation– and of the candidates themselves.\n",
      "A backdoor may take the form of a hidden part of a program, a separate program (e.g. Back Orifice may subvert the system through a rootkit), code in the firmware of the hardware, or parts of an operating system such as Windows. Trojan horses can be used to create vulnerabilities in a device. A Trojan horse may appear to be an entirely legitimate program, but when executed, it triggers an activity that may install a backdoor. Although some are secretly installed, other backdoors are deliberate and widely known. These kinds of backdoors have \"legitimate\" uses such as providing the manufacturer with a way to restore user passwords.\n",
      "Many systems that store information within the cloud fail to create accurate security measures. If many systems are connected within the cloud, hackers can gain access to all other platforms through the most vulnerable system. Default passwords (or other default credentials) can function as backdoors if they are not changed by the user. Some debugging features can also act as backdoors if they are not removed in the release version. In 1993, the United States government attempted to deploy an encryption system, the Clipper chip, with an explicit backdoor for law enforcement and national security access. The chip was unsuccessful.\n",
      "Recent proposals to counter backdoors include creating a database of backdoors' triggers and then using neural networks to detect them.\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m\n",
